<p>Jump2 is still under development. Don't expect a completely
stable development environment. Jump2 might or might not work as
expected. Don't blame me if something goes wrong - you have been
warned...</p>

<p>This text describes the memory management used by Jump. </p>

<p>This text is for those interested in the internals of Jump.
You don't need to know anything described here if you only want
to write programs with Jump. In fact, you should not write code
that relies on the memory management mechanisms described here.</p>

<h1><a name="allocation"></a> 1 Memory allocation</h1>

<p>Jump has 4 types of memory chunks, organized in 3 heaps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>instances (Object Heap)</li>
    <li>small array data-chunks (RawData Heap)</li>
    <li>big array data-chunks (RawData Heap)</li>
    <li>(Huge Model only) proxy objects (Proxy Heap)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instances and small array data-chunks are allocated from
bigger blocks (currently 4 KByte), big array data-chunks each get
their own blocks. All chunks are non-movable, and I use the
absolute pointers as object references.</p>

<p>The most important memory management structure is the block.</p>

<h2>Memory management data structures</h2>

<p>These are the data structures used in Jump's memory
management, in bottom-up order.</p>

<h3>Chunk </h3>

<table border="3">
    <tr>
        <td align="right"><strong>Offset</strong></td>
        <td align="right"><strong>Size</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Content</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">0</td>
        <td align="right">2</td>
        <td>Bytes consumed by this chunk. This is a multiple of 8
        and includes this &quot;byte count&quot; word.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">2</td>
        <td align="right">x</td>
        <td>User data</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>A chunk can be free or used (i.e. free space is also encoded
using the &quot;chunk&quot; data structure). Being used is not
encoded in the chunk's data structure, only in the block's
allocation array. Chunks have variable length (multiple of 8
bytes). Within a block, a chunk is immediately followed by the
next chunk.</p>

<h3>Block</h3>

<table border="3">
    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top"><strong>Offset</strong></td>
        <td align="right" valign="top"><strong>Size</strong></td>
        <td valign="top"><strong>Content</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">-8</td>
        <td align="right">4</td>
        <td>(only for Huge Model) record's unique ID of this
        block.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right">-4</td>
        <td align="right">4</td>
        <td>(only for Huge Model) record's handle of this block.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top">0</td>
        <td align="right" valign="top">4</td>
        <td valign="top">Pointer to next block of this heap,
        forming a linked list of blocks.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top">4</td>
        <td align="right" valign="top">64</td>
        <td valign="top">Allocation bit-array (one bit per 8 byte
        of memory).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="right" valign="top">68</td>
        <td align="right" valign="top">4096</td>
        <td valign="top">Storage, allocated in units of 8 byte.
        This area contains chunks. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>In the allocation array, there's one bit for every 8-byte unit
of storage. Only those bits are relevant that correspond to a
chunk beginning. Those corresponding to a position in the middle
of a chunk are ignored. A &quot;1&quot; bit means that the
corresponding chunk is in use.</p>

<p>The last chunk is normally a single empty chunk occupying all
space left in the block. Allocating a new chunk normally means
splitting this empty chunk into a first part (for the new chunk)
and a second part, now forming the empty rest.</p>

<h2>Allocation process</h2>

<p>Memory allocation is always requested for a specific heap. The
steps for allocating a new chunkfrom a heap are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Look for a free chunk, big enough for the request,
        starting at the current offset in the current block. Exit
        if found.</li>
    <li>Start a garbage collection, then look again for a free
        chunk big enough for the request. Exit if found.</li>
    <li>Add a new block to the heap, then allocate the chunk from
        this new block.</li>
</ol>

<p>If an empty chunk is bigger than the size requested, it is
split into parts. The first part is used for the request, the
second part stays unused.</p>

<p>If a chunk is requested that exceeds the block size, it is
allocated in its own block (of course, this block is allocated
big enough to hold the requested chunk). </p>

<p>Allocation of blocks is normally done by means of the
MemPtrNew systrap. Only in the Huge Model, for the Object and the
RawData Heaps, DmNewRecord is used instead.</p>

<hr>

<h1><a name="garbage"></a>2 Garbage collection</h1>

<p>Jump's garbage collector (GC) can be classified as a
conservative mark-and-sweep collector. </p>

<p>Jump's GC doesn't know the layout of the fields of a class or
of the stack entries. So it assumes that any 4-byte pattern that
reads like an address of an object chunk might be a valid Java
reference, and should cause this chunk to be marked &quot;in
use&quot;. This will probably include some &quot;false
pointers&quot;, but the only effect will be that some unused
object might stay in memory a little bit longer than necessary.</p>

<p>Valid references can be found in the following sources:</p>

<ul>
    <li>In the registers.</li>
    <li>On the stack (Jump uses only the 68K cpu's stack). A
        valid reference can begin on any 16-bit word boundary, as
        16-bit stack entries are allowed with the 68K cpu.</li>
    <li>In static fields of reference type.</li>
    <li>In instance fields of instances found to be &quot;in
        use&quot;. A valid reference can begin on any 16-bit word
        boundary, as fields are only word-aligned, not
        double-word-aligned.</li>
    <li>In the data portion of &quot;in-use&quot; reference-type
        arrays. A valid reference can only begin on a 32-bit
        double-word boundary (relative to the data portion's
        start).</li>
</ul>

<p>The GC starts be removing all &quot;in use&quot; bits from the
allocation arrays of the blocks. </p>

<p>Iterating over all the sources mentioned above, the GC then
marks all validly referenced objects. For every potential
reference, it does the following steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check against the bounds in the Object Heap structure
        (valid references always go only into the Object Heap).
        If the pointer lies below the lowest chunk address or
        above the highest chunk address, it can't be valid, and
        it's ignored.</li>
    <li>Iterate through the linked list of blocks. If the pointer
        falls into the storage area of a block, assume it is
        valid.</li>
    <li>Set the corresponding &quot;in use&quot; bit of the
        allocation array. There's no check for pointers going
        into the middle of a chunk in this step. The bit is set
        anyway, but it will be ignored if it doesn't correspond
        to a chunk's beginning.</li>
</ol>

<p>The new &quot;in use&quot; bits can add new sources to the
root set described above. So this process is repeated until no
new &quot;in use&quot; bit arises in an iteration.</p>

<p>Then the GC sweeps over the heap blocks. It combines adjacent
free chunks to bigger chunks to avoid fragmentation. If a block
the consists of only one free chunk, the whole block is removed
from the heap and given back to the OS.</p>
